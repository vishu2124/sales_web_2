<h2>The problem with "once-a-week CRMs"</h2>
<p>To get the most out of a sales management system, people need to want to use it – it needs to be helpful in day-to-day business. Far too often CRMs end up being these tedious and tiresome points of data entry on the final day of the week. <strong>The problem here? People forget</strong> – they forget deals, contacts and deadlines, which makes the “once-a-week CRM” basically useless.</p> 

<h2>Eye candy, aka why good looks and ease of use make a difference</h2>
<p>A good sales management software is <strong>visually appealing</strong> and gives the user a <strong>comprehensive view of the situation</strong>. It’s simple to use, as if customization were a religion and drag-and-drop its holy script. Think about it, every businesses are different, but most people generally like simplicity.</p>
